    <h5>JSON-LD 1.1</h5>
<P>JSON-LD 1.1 is a lightweight data interchange format for JSON-based representation of Linked Data, aiming to facilitate the use of Linked Data principles on the web. It interlinks various knowledge from several sources into a compatible format that is easily understandable by machines for further usage. By embedding structured data into web pages, it enhances the functionality of search results and further supports the smooth interaction between different systems. JSON-LD 1.1 is used together with the vocabularies, such as Schema.org, in order to describe consistently products or events, for example. It plays a fundamental role in the development of the Semantic Web.</P>
