        <h5>JSON-LD 1.1</h5>
      <p>JSON-LD 1.1 is important because it reduces the friction associated with integrating and exchanging structured data on the Web. This, in turn, enhances collaboration and communication between diverse systems. The data in this format is easily comprehensible to search engines and other utilities regarding its meaning. It results in increased understanding of data, manifested in better search results, such as rich snippets. Because this format is human-readable, both machines and developers are able to use the data efficiently. Besides, it promotes the semantic web-a web that has connected data and understands such data in context. This, later on, would facilitate a more intelligent and interactive experience for users while on the web.</p>
