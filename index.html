        <p>My first Webpage this was a little hard ive been messing up a lot mostly with spelling because i am so used to autocorrection but i feel like this is good for me so i can stop feeling like i am depending on these things i also am starting to feel a little comfortable with HTML and i am ready to code i am enjoying it a lot!
            <h3>What I Learned </h3>
            <p>1. I learned how to put a link into my code.
                <p>2. I also learned that if you use a captial letter it messes up everything in your code  </p>
                <p>3. One last thing i noticed is that if you check your code and it looks fine theres always one problem when you validate it </p>
            

        
        <p>Learning about HTML structure helped me put this code together also Learning about basic attributes is helping define my tags one last thing would be HTML Elment Relationships its been a great help on helping me understand the value of two or more elements together </p>
