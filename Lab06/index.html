        <h2>CRAP Design Principle</h2>
        <p>The BMW website effectively employs CRAP design principles of Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity to enhance visual appeal and navigation. High contrast highlights key features, while repetition ensures a consistent brand image with uniform logos, fonts, and colors. Alignment organizes content for easy access, and proximity groups related information, like car details and buying options. These choices create a sleek professional look that improves usability and reinforces BMWâ€™s upscale reputation.</p>
